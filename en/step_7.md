## Challenge: Build and share amazing Weather data dashboards

There are loads of ways to configure your dashboard on Initial State. What interesting correlations between different can you uncover?

- If your Weather Station is mounted onto the side of a building, are there any environmental changes that affect your data? If the air conditioning is activated, does this create a breeze or increase the external temperature?

- Use the different views available to look for regular changes.

- Once you've been streaming data for a while, can you see seasonal changes occurring?

### Sharing dashboards
