## What you will need

You need to have built and installed your Oracle Weather Station kit.  If you have not done that yet, follow [these instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/weather-station-guide/), and then come back here when you've finished!

The steps in this guide assume that you will be regularly uploading data to Initial State. You can do this *and* continue to upload data to the Oracle database.

### Hardware

- A Raspberry Pi Oracle Weather Station kit.

### software

- The [Oracle Weather Station software](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/weather-station-guide/software.md){:target="_blank"}.


 - The Python `ISStreamer` library. It can be installed by logging on to the Pi at the heart of your Weather Statio,  opening a terminal window and typing:

     ```bash
     sudo pip3 install ISStreamer

     ```
